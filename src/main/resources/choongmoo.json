  "history" : "Shoo-Moo was the name given to the great Admiral Yee Soon-sin of the Lee Dynasty. He was reputed to have invented the first armoured battleship, the Koe-buck-son, in fifteen-ninety-two, which is said to be the precursor of the present day submarine. The reason why this pattern ends with a left-hand attack is to symbolize his regrettable death, having no chance to sow his unrestrained potentiality checked by the forced reservation of his loyalty to the king.",
